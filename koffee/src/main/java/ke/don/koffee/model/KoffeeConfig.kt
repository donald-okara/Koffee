/**
 * Configuration for the Koffee toasts.

 * @property layout The composable function to be used for the toast layout. It takes a [ToastData]
 * object as a parameter, which contains the data to be displayed in the toast.
 * @property dismissible A boolean value indicating whether the toast can be dismissed by the user.
 * If true, the toast can be dismissed by swiping it away.
 * @property durationResolver A function that resolves the duration of the toast. It takes a
 * [ToastDuration] object as a parameter and returns the duration in milliseconds. If null is
 * returned, the toast will be displayed indefinitely until dismissed by the user. The default
 * duration resolver uses the [defaultDurationResolver] function.
