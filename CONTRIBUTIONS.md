# ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions of all kinds to Koffee! Whether it's bug fixes, feature suggestions, improvements to documentation, or entirely new features, your input is appreciated.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a **new branch** for your feature or fix.
4. Make your changes.
5. Ensure your code is well-tested and documented.
6. Submit a **pull request** to the `master` branch.

## Contribution Standards

* Keep your changes focused and minimal.
* Follow existing code style and architecture.
* Write clear commit messages following the **Conventional Commits** standard (e.g., `feat: add espresso support`, `fix: correct milk frother logic`).
* PR titles should follow the same convention and include a suffix indicating the related issue (e.g., `fix: correct milk frother logic (Fixes #42)`).
* For major changes, consider discussing them in an issue first.
* Link any related issues in your PR description.
* Delete your feature branch after merge to keep the repository clean.

## Commit & PR Best Practices

**Commit messages should:**

* Start with a type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`).
* Be written in present tense (e.g., `add feature` not `added feature`).
* Be short but descriptive (max \~50 characters for the subject line).
* Include additional context in the body if needed.

**Pull requests should:**

* Be small and focused on one change.
* Pass all CI checks.
* Include screenshots or examples for UI changes.
* Reference related issues with `Fixes #issue` or `Closes #issue` when applicable.
